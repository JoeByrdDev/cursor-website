# Game Development Rules

## Game Architecture
- The game uses a tile-based grid system (20px tiles)
- Canvas size: 560x620 pixels (28x31 grid)
- Game state includes: player position, ghosts, pellets, score, lives
- Animation loop uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth 60fps gameplay

## Code Standards
- Use descriptive variable names (e.g., `TILE`, `COLS`, `ROWS`)
- Implement proper collision detection for walls and game objects
- Handle keyboard input with event listeners for arrow keys and WASD
- Use consistent indentation and spacing
- Comment complex game logic and algorithms

## Game Features
- Player movement with collision detection
- Pellet collection system
- Ghost AI and movement patterns
- Score tracking and lives system
- Game over and restart functionality
- Responsive canvas that scales on mobile

## Performance
- Use efficient rendering techniques
- Minimize DOM manipulation during gameplay
- Implement proper cleanup for event listeners
