# CSS Styling Rules

## Design System
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) defined in `:root`
- Color scheme: Dark theme with blue accents (`--accent: #60a5fa`)
- Typography: System font stack for optimal performance
- Spacing: Use consistent padding and margin values

## Layout Principles
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Use `clamp()` for fluid typography and spacing
- Container max-width: 1000px with responsive padding
- Sticky header with backdrop blur effect

## Component Styles
- Buttons: Gradient background with hover effects and box shadows
- Cards: Subtle borders, rounded corners, and gradient backgrounds
- Navigation: Clean links with hover states
- Status elements: Muted text color for secondary information

## Interactive Elements
- Smooth transitions (0.2s ease) for hover states
- Transform effects for button interactions
- Focus states for accessibility
- Proper contrast ratios for text readability

## Game-Specific Styles
- Canvas styling with rounded corners and borders
- Flow diagram components with distinct node types
- Widget panel layouts for interactive elements
