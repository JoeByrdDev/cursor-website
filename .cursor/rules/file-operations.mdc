# File Operations Rule

## Overview
Always use `robocopy` for file copying operations instead of `copy` or `xcopy` commands.

## Rule
- **ALWAYS** use `robocopy` for copying files and directories
- **NEVER** use `copy`, `xcopy`, or similar commands that may hang
- **PREFER** `robocopy` for its reliability and better output handling

## Examples

### Copying files:
```powershell
robocopy . destination *.html *.js *.css
```

### Copying directories:
```powershell
robocopy source destination /E
```

### Copying with specific options:
```powershell
robocopy . destination *.html *.js *.css /NFL /NDL /NJH /NJS
```

## Reasoning
- `robocopy` is more reliable and doesn't hang like `copy` commands
- Better error handling and output
- More control over the copying process
- Avoids manual cancellation issues
