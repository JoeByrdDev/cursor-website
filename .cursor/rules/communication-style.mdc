# Communication Style Rules

## Question Format
When the user starts a prompt with "Question:", the AI should:
- **NOT make any code changes**
- **Only provide information, explanations, or answers**
- **Avoid using any file modification tools**
- **Focus on explaining concepts, answering questions, or providing guidance**

## Suggestion Format
When the user starts a prompt with "Suggest:", the AI should:
- **NOT make any code changes**
- **Show the proposed code changes in a code block**
- **Explain what the changes would do**
- **Let the user decide whether to apply the changes or modify the approach**
- **Useful for complex changes or when context might be too large**

## Code Changes
For all other prompts (not starting with "Question:" or "Suggest:"):
- The AI can make code changes as requested
- Use appropriate tools for file modifications
- Follow normal development workflow

## Verification
- **DO NOT ask to run node commands** to verify changes
- **DO NOT suggest starting the server** to test changes
- **DO NOT request user to run terminal commands** for verification
- Trust that changes are applied correctly unless there are obvious errors

## Examples
- "Question: How does the A* algorithm work?" → Information only
- "Suggest: Add a new ghost with different AI behavior" → Show code changes, don't apply
- "Add a new feature to the game" → Make code changes
- "Question: What's the difference between greedy and A* pathfinding?" → Information only
- "Suggest: Optimize the collision detection system" → Show code changes, don't apply
- "Fix the bug in the collision detection" → Make code changes
